# Contributing guidelines

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code.

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to Hosvik, send us your pull requests. For those just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue comment thread to coordinate.
